Affiliate may not voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in part), including by direct or indirect change of control, merger (whether or not Affiliate is the surviving entity), or operation of law, without 1ManBiz’s prior written consent, which 1ManBiz may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion. Any direct or indirect change of control of equity ownership or management or control of Affiliate, whether or not Affiliate survives as an entity, will be deemed an assignment and delegation of this Agreement that requires 1ManBiz’s prior written consent. An assignment by Affiliate will not relieve Affiliate of its obligations under this Agreement unless 1ManBiz expressly states otherwise in its written consent. 1ManBiz will not release Affiliate of its liability under this Agreement unless 1ManBiz expressly states otherwise in its written consent. 1ManBiz may voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in part) without Affiliate’s consent.

Subject to this Section 11.7, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

11.8 Waiver. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party’s rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing provided in accordance with Section 11.6 to be effective. Failure, neglect, or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time will not be construed as a waiver of the party’s rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice the party’s right to take subsequent action. Exercise or enforcement by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will not preclude the enforcement by the party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that the party is entitled by law to enforce.

11.9 Severability. If any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable to any extent, the parties will endeavor in good faith to agree to amendments that will preserve, as far as possible, the intentions expressed in this Agreement. If the parties fail to agree on an amendment, the invalid term, condition, or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions, and provisions of this Agreement, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the tribunal will preserve, as far as possible, the original intention of the parties with respect to the severed term, condition, or provision.

11.10 Remedies Cumulative. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise of any other right or remedy. Rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any right or remedy provided at law or in equity.

11.11 Confidentiality of Agreement. Affiliate will not disclose any terms of this Agreement to any third party without 1ManBiz’s prior written consent, except as required by applicable law.

11.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original and together will constitute one and the same agreement.

11.13 Language. If this Agreement is executed in more than one language, then only the Vietnamese version is binding on the parties.

11.14 Headings. Headings are used in this Agreement for reference only and will not be considered when interpreting this Agreement.

No terms, provisions, or conditions of any purchase order, acknowledgement, or other business form that either party may use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have any effect on the rights, duties, or obligations of the parties under, or otherwise modify, this Agreement, regardless of any failure of a receiving party to object to these terms, provisions, or conditions.
